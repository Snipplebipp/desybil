	\section{Approach}
		\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Interface Addresses}
			\subsubsection{The Easy Way}
				Let's just ask some hardware manufacturers about the
				relationship between their interface addresses.
			\subsubsection{Acquiring Samples}
				First, we should try to get some hardware manufacturers to 
				share a database of hardware addresses and serial numbers.
			\subsubsection{Analysis Techniques}
				% Still have to look into this.
		\subsection{Cross-Protocol Information Leaks}
			It is very unlikely that we will find a 100% successful attack.
			Instead we look for attacks that can increase our probability.
			
			We have only a few ideas for different types of attacks; as we
			continue our literature review, we will develop more.
			\subsubsection{Call Interface Transfer}
			\subsubsection{Software Dependencies}
			% Other attacks can go here
		\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}
			Set up booth in the campus center and attract participants; Ask
			participants for one hardware interface address on their mobile
			device.

			Perform various De-Sybil experiments, asking the participant to
			cooperate as needed.
			% Describe how each experiment will be controlled.
			
			Record results % What results are we looking for?
